 * > Attacks can be held with [X] in both forms to create a stronger attack
 *      > Ex: Piercing/multiple arrows in bow form and stronger/larger hitbox in sword form
 * > When holding [Shift] (slows down movement), player's hitbox should be visible
 * > When pressing [C] (changing forms), there should be a small delay afterwards to avoid spamming.
 * > Focus can enable a reticle when in bow form or enter a defensive stance in sword form
